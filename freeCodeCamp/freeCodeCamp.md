# 🔥 freeCodeCamp Algorithms and Data Structures 🔥

Took freeCodeCamp's [course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hly31xKli0) on algorithms and data structures and although a lot of the stuff I already knew, it was really useful.

# 📚 New stuff learned 📚

* New algorithms
  * Quick sort `O(n*log(n))` - this one was a little trickier but I got it
  * Selection sort `O(n^2)`
  * Bogo sort `O(random)` - this one is useless really, as it its really slow and unreliable
* Tail Call optimization - some languages can optimize recursion using tail call optimization, it makes a function call but doesnt allocate more stack space
* Space complexity - how much memory the algorithm uses
* Algorithm correctness - algorithm has to produce a correct result, terminated
* Growth rate - big O notation grows based on the inputs provided
* Runtimes
  * Logarithmic `O(log(n))`
  * Quadratic `O(n^2)`
  * Linear `O(n)`
  * Constant `O(1)`
  * Exponential `O(n^k)`
* Good Big O notation doesnt really mean that the algorithm is good, because of operation time. Merge sort's operation time is longer than Quick sort's, even though it has a better worst case scenario, Quick sort might be better
